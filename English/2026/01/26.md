### 💡 Gemini's Analysis & Coaching

* **"Hands" & "Stars":** Focused on the voiced /z/ ending.
* **"Concerned":** Practicing the /d/ ending to ensure it doesn't sound like a /t/.
* **Transcription Error:** "Reconinies" at the end—likely a misinterpretation of weaklings.

### 💡 Gemini's Analysis & Coaching

* MacWhisper correctly identified **weaklings** this time, which means your enunciation of the final "-gs" (/ɡz/) was clear enough for the AI to distinguish it from the previous "reconinies" error.
* **Humans** vs **Heavens**: The verse typically uses "heavens," but you said "humans" in both transcripts. If this was intentional for practice, your /m/ to /z/ transition in "humans" is very clear.
  * Exaggerate the "V": Try to make the "V" in "Heavens" very long and buzzy (like a bee: Heavvvvvens).
  * Smile on "Heavens": The /ɛ/ in heavens is a wider vowel than the /uː/ in humans. Pulling the corners of your mouth back slightly can help distinguish the two even with a stuffy nose.
* *Concerned about us*: In your second transcript, you successfully caught the /d/ ending in "concerned."
