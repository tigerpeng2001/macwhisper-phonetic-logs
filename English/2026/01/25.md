## 💡 Gemini's Analysis & Coaching

### ✅ Successes
* **Phonetic Accuracy:** You successfully triggered the correct words for "openly says" and "son of God" in the Tiny model.
* **Flow:** The linking between "is-the" and "son-of" is smooth.

### 🛠️ Areas for Improvement
1. **The "D" in "God":**
   * **Problem:** Transcript shows "GOT" (de-voicing the final consonant).
   * **Fix:** Keep vocal cords vibrating until the very end. Feel the "buzz" in your throat.
2. **The "Z" sound in "Stays":**
   * **Problem:** It sounds like a sharp 'S'.
   * **Fix:** Practice a soft 'Z' sound at the end: "Stay-zzz."

## 🚩 Self-Evaluation
* **Confidence:** 8/10
* **Goal for Next Session:** Soften the final "D" in "God."
