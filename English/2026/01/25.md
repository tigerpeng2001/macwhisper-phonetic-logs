> "God, this is one with everyone who opens his Jesus' name, Jesus' name of God. This is the hall with the one with God and our sure God knows us."

**Gemini Analysis:**
* **Issue:** "Openly says" misheard as "opens his."
* **Fix:** Sharpen the $/s/$ sound in "says" and ensure the "ly" in "openly" is voiced.
