## 💡 Gemini's Analysis & Coaching

### ✅ Successes
* **Phonetic Accuracy:** You successfully triggered the correct words for "openly says" and "son of God" in the Tiny model, which is a high bar for clarity.
* **Flow:** The linking between "is-the" and "son-of" is smooth.

### 🛠️ Areas for Improvement
1. **The "D" in "God":**
   * **Problem:** The transcript shows "GOT," meaning you are "de-voicing" the final consonant.
   * **Fix:** Keep your vocal cords vibrating until the very end of the word. Practice saying "Go-dddd" with your hand on your throat to feel the buzz.
2. **The "Z" sound in "Stays":**
   * **Problem:** "STAY'S" (with an apostrophe) suggests a sharp 'S'. In English, the 's' in "stays" should sound like a soft 'Z'.
   * **Fix:** Practice "Stay-zzz."

## 🚩 Self-Evaluation
* **Confidence:** 8/10
* **Goal for Next Session:** Soften the final "D" in "God" to avoid the "T" sound.
