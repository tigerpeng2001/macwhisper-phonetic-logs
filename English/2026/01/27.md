## 🔬 Gemini's Analysis & Coaching

### 🎯 Phonetic Challenges
| Target Phrase | Actual Transcript | Analysis |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"let your"** | "that you're" | The "L" in *let* was likely muffled by nasal congestion, causing the AI to hear a "th" sound. |
| **"lead me"** | "let me" | The long /iː/ in *lead* was shortened. When /d/ meets /m/, it can "stop" the sound, making it sound like *let*. |
| **"right path"** | "bright path" | A "plosive swap." The tongue position for /r/ was likely affected by mouth tension, adding a /b/ sound. |

### 👃 Physical Factor: Nasal Congestion
* **Observation:** The substitution of "bright" for "right" and "that" for "let" is consistent with **denasal speech** (stuffy nose). 
* **Impact:** Reduced airflow through the nasal cavity changes the resonance of vowels and makes liquid sounds like **/l/** and **/r/** much harder for AI models to distinguish.

### 💡 Coaching Tips
1. **The "L" Anchor:** For "Let" and "Lead," ensure the tip of your tongue firmly touches the ridge behind your upper teeth. Even with a cold, this physical contact helps define the sound.
2. **The "R" Space:** To fix "bright" vs "right," focus on pulling the tongue back without letting the lips touch. If the lips touch or "pop," it triggers the /b/ sound MacWhisper heard.
3. **Vowel Length:** Stretch the "ee" in **lead** (/liːd/). Making it longer than the "e" in **let** (/lɛt/) will help the AI distinguish the two words.
