# 🗣️ Language Pronunciation Journey: M4 Max Edition

This repository is a version-controlled log of my journey toward native-level pronunciation in English and Chinese. I use my Mac's Neural Engine to run "Honest AI" models that highlight my mistakes rather than hiding them.

## 🛠️ The Tech Stack
* **Hardware:** MacBook Pro (M4 Max)
* **Transcription:** [MacWhisper](https://macwhisper.com) (using the **Tiny** model for "Zero-Autocorrect" feedback).
* **Storage:** GitHub with **Git LFS** for audio tracking.
* **Coach:** Gemini AI (for phonetic analysis and mouth-position exercises).

## 📈 Initial Practice Session: Jan 25, 2026

### **Target Verse**
> "God stays one with everyone who openly says Jesus is the Son of God. This is how we stay one with God and assure God loves us."

### **Version 1 (The "Tiny" Ear)**
* **Transcript:** `God, this is one with everyone who opens his Jesus' name, Jesus' name of God. This is the hall with the one with God and our sure God knows us.`
* **Diagnosis:** Significant confusion around "stays one" and "openly says."

### **Version 2 (The Correction)**
* **Transcript:** `GOT STAY'S WON with everyone who openly says Jesus is the son of God this is how we stay in one with God and are sure God loves us.`
* **Improvements:** Successfully captured "openly says," "son of God," and "loves us."

## 💡 Gemini's Foundational Feedback
| Error Found | Phonetic Reason | Correction Exercise |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **"GOT"** instead of **GOD** | Hard "T" cutoff. | Throat vibration: Feel the "D" hum. |
| **"KNOWS"** vs **LOVES** | Soft "L" placement. | Tongue-to-roof contact behind teeth. |
| **"R-SURE"** | Missing linking "R". | Practice "Linking": *And-ah-R-sure*. |
